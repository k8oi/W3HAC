Start playing white noise
Start WSJTX
Ensure the WSJTX Pwr level is about 18% (for K8OI) - you need to test and ensure no ALC movement and you are getting the power out that you want
Start PstRotator
WSTX - select band
RemoteHams - press Tune 3 times
WATCH the ALC on the RemoteHams display - you do NOT want it to MOVE at ALL
WATCH the PowerOut on the KPA1500 box- aim for 25-35 watts out as a good starting point
